# VIETNAM_GDP_MODEL
This is my machine learning project to construct a relationship between GDP of Vietnam
and some factors that can significantly affect its growth. 
After researching knowledge about GDP in Economics area, I chose:
1. Gross capital formation at current price
2. Final consumption at current prices
3. Export OF goods and services at current prices
4. Import OF goods and services at current prices
5. Gross domestic product at current prices divided by economic sector
6. Consumer Price Index (CPI) 
7. Producer Price Index (PPI) 
8. Exchange Rate 
9. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) 
10. Labor Force 15 Years and Older
11. Natural Disaster 
12. Population
